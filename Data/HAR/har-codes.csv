,Provision for Bad Debts,"The 2017 HAR Formset reflects the changes to accounting for Bad Debt and it is now classified as a Contractual Adjustment, not an Operating Expense. 

The provision for actual or expected doubtful accounts resulting from the extension of credit. This includes the total dollar amount charged for health care services that were provided for which there was an expectation of payment. Do not include charity care or self pay discounts in this category; only include the portion of the charge for which there was an expectation of payment. 

In determining whether to classify charity care as bad debt expense, the facility must consider the following points:
A. The facility must presume that the patient is able and willing to pay until and unless the facility has reason to consider this a charity care case under its charity care policy and the facility classifies this as a charity care case; and
B. The facility may include as bad debt expense unpaid deductibles, co-insurance, co-payments, and charges for non-covered services and any other unpaid patient responsibilities.
